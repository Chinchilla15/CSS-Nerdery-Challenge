- HTML5
- CSS

## Process and Considerations

This project is a simple dashboard mockup. The challenge was to follow the Figma design and implement it using pure CSS styles and layout. I aimed for a pixel-perfect design based on the provided dimensions (1027 x 768) using semantic HTML tags and pure CSS. For the layout, I utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox where necessary, ensuring natural responsiveness. The page adapts to larger screens without the need for media queries.
